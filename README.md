# Derick.py

Derrick.py a script that is build just to give you a chuckle or a new found existential crisis
Build in python obvs. 

## Who is Derrick?

Who is Derrick a fabulous question if I must say so my self. It is the best name known to man, even tho I can imagine a kid with the name Derrick only a 40 year old man. It is still the best English name second in line to Loretta who is Loretta? I don't know and I think I will never know.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
Every time you run the script Derrick will randomly pick something from it's 50 plus archive to shoot out of the terminal. Built on Linux but I don't see an issue running it any where else the only extra thing it uses is RANDOM to randomly pick quotes. So just pip install that is you get errors or something like that I guess...

## Why was this created?
Your guess is as good as mine. Mainly just to play around with python something I haven't done in a long time.

## Will this ever come to my Linux repo?
Bro what distro maintainer will ever let something like this onto there package manager?? And even if so I'll have to make the script run in any folder which shouldn't be too hard right? RIGHT?

## Does it run on windows??
It should I dont really know i use linux. If the exe doesnt work then use the .py file
